          The growls of the Minotaur can be heard ringing through the narrow pavements of the labyrinth, as your bot makes it's​ way inside. Using a smartphone/remote, the participant has to *control a bot* inside a labyrinth filled with the unknown till it reaches an escape​.
          The only way you can make sense of the inside is through a *live stream.*
          Do you have what it takes to face the terrors that lie inside? (Bots will be provided - Just Run the bot & conquer it like 'tomb raider')

            Indian Society for Technical Education (ISTE) conducted an amazing event by the name of ‘ROBOSPRINT’. 
            The event was divided into three parts. The first part consisted of physical obstacles for the bot to overcome. This part also consisted of a simple problem related to mechanics. The next part consisted of coding. Participants had to get the output for the given problem statement in a time span of 30 minutes. The last part of the event had circuit building at its core. The participants had to assemble the given circuit of line follower bot and then using the same bot had to reach the finish line. A total of 20 minutes was allotted for completion of this task. The participants completing all the three tasks in the shortest time were adjudged the winners of the event.
            A total of 20 teams participated in the event.
            The success of the event can be attributed to sheer hardwork and dedication of all the team members. The extensive publicity by the PR team, the combined efforts of the event and technical team to get the track together on time and the excellent work of the creative team in getting the posters as well as the delicate portions of the track ready on time. These factors combined to make the event hugely successful.

        The Earth is in a major catastrophe, being destroyed to the very last piece; the inhabitants of the Earth must be teleported to an alien planet through a secret tunnel built by scientists. This is to be done by a special manned robot car by safely sending each human seeking refuge through a vertical tunnel down to the alien planet. This is a two player game, where the first player controls a lower bot (collects the people) and the second player controls the upper bot (teleports people). Overcoming the obstacles efficiently, the team which can teleport maximum people in the stipulated time will be the winning team.
